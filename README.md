MY PLANS

My plan is to create a site or a webpage based system that makes the life of people easier like to have a server software that accepts the data from the user like for example if i have to transport a heavy duty goods from one place to other i will  upload the details about the goods and the base price i am ready to pay for the transportation now the server will put it on a table where the people who own vechicles and  who are looking for transport contracts will come to know about this deal and there will be a kind of bidding process where the deal will be given to the transporter who is ready to transoprt on the lowest amount or cost so that it will be helpfull for the people to make  a efficient use of their money and to reduce corruption and similar kind off illegal activities . For this can also be turned into a business like some percent of the amount will paid to the website as a commision and a great way to run a online business . We can also design this logic not only for transport but also for any kindoff money related contracts wherein the work can be done at a cost efficient platform and high amount of loss of money can be avoided . This can work only if we have a strong public support and a set of delears willing to play a fair game. Rather than going in person the work can be done in a easier and most efficient manner this can drastically improve the life style of people around us and we can also bring about a stability in the economic manner .
