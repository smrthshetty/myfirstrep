   Natural disasters the first thing that comes to my mind is "Precaution is better than cure" . Basically natural disasters are the ways of nature telling man that you have put a lot of weight on me time to get rid of some . Talking about natural disasters the most common ones are earthquake , tusnami , hurricane , volcanic erruption . Today science has gone so far that we are able to pridict the vibrations from a body that is earth . Really science is beautifull . But as we know its coming we are not able to stop it that are out of our imaginations.
   First and foremost we have to start with the youth as we all know they say youth are the future of this nation . If you go to the root of this no school or college teaches what is the power of nature and how to live with it . Questions like the basic precaution needed to be taken while a natural disaster strikes are no where taught for example in the case of earthquake its safer to stay under a table , what are the signs of a natural disaster just before it strikes so that we can increase the chances of our survival using limited resources. And also making the youth more precaution oriented rather than making than cure oriented . This would be a great lead .
    As we all know today the technology is at the top end . If i consider a earthquake then they have these beds called earthquake proof beds that detects these waves and turns into a secured box or coffin like structure that provides food , water and oxygen so that you can be alive until the rescue team arrives (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slQwB0uCZkc). But these techs are priced sky high and is not affordable by all so whats the use of such items right . But  if the government collaborates with these types of companies it would be a life saviour , these techs will be available to common man so all have a higher chance of survival than expected . But as we know coruption
is at its highest peak . And if these technologies can be linked with the detecting systems then it would be a miracle and a 100% life saviour .
    One more important drawback in the lack of people studing in these fields . As we all know the study of these subjects really in a small scale . Hardly you will find a few meteorologist or seismologists in this country so its really important to encourage the study of these subjects that can give us a whole new perspective of looking into this probem and a lot of new ways to solve this so its important to encourage the study of these and provide some scholarships and job opportunities from the government that will make a lot of difference.But finally i want to conclude that whatever may be the disaster its karma that decides whether you live or die .
