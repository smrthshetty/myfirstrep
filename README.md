# myfirstrep
my first repository on github
My plan is to create a site or a webpage based system that makes the life of people easier like to have a server software that accepts the data from the user like for example if i have to transport a heavy duty goods from one place to other i will  upload the details about the goods and the base price i am ready to pay for the transportation now the server will put it on a table where the people who own vechicles and  who are looking for transport contracts will come to know about this deal and there will be a kind of bidding process where the deal will be given to the transporter who is ready to transoprt on the lowest amount or cost so that it will be helpfull for the people to make  a efficient use of their money and to reduce corruption and similar kind off illegal activities
